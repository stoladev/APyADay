- [Virtual
  Assistant](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/machine-learning/virtual_assistant)
    - A virtual assistant, dubbed "Aimi" (an Artificially Intelligent Mentoring
      Interface), will be tracked for progress here. The end goal? To create
      an interface that is flawless for any user, regardless of their
      technological ability. Hand gestures, voice recognition, and
      understanding complex and different commands while using a neural network
      are all aspirations for this project. This will fill my need of creating
      a virtual assistant that blows all of these other assistants out of the
      water - at least in its ease/usability.
