Programming felt like a breeze today. I believe I am starting to get the hang
of it. I've created two cipher encoder/decoder scripts, with neither of them
having any "outside code snippets". It was a long experience for the first
one, but the second one (the one that starts with a V) came much easier after
the initial experience.

Side note:
I've received one of the first of many items to improve my programming
experience: the standing desk. While I don't have the rest of the necessary
items to make it fully functional (the keyboard, monitor, etc), it still
seems to improve my ability to write code for prolonged periods of time 
without distraction. However, I must keep in mind this might be a placebo.
Regardless, I enjoy it.
