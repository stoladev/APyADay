## Vim to Emacs?

I am contemplating switching over from Vim, which I have just started learning
and "getting good at", to Emacs. From all of the research I've done with my
spare time regarding a long-term solution for text editing and general
filesystem manipulation with a highlight of programming, Emacs seems to be
everything Vim is and more, while the opposite cannot be said. Everything Vim
can do, Emacs can do. Not everything Emacs can do, Vim can do. Or so I've
heard.

## Difficulty of Emacs

I've began messing with the .emacs file (.vimrc equivalent) and it seems pretty
straightforward. I still need to catch up to what I've "perfected", for the
time being, on my original init.vim, but maybe I'll get there in time for
Monday.
