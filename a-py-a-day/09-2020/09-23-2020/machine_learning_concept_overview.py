General reminders:
    - Deep Learning refers to NN with more than one hidden layer.
    - Supervised learning algorithms are trained using labeled examples.

Process:
    - Data acquisition
    - Data cleaning
    - Split cleaned data into ~30% test data, rest into training and building the model
    - Complete model testing using test data
    - Adjust model parameters so it suits the required output

Validation:
    - Training data (used to train model parameters)
    - Validation data (used to determine what model hyper-parameters to adjust)
    - Test data (used to get some final performance metric)

Over-fitting/Under-fitting:
    - Model fits too much to the noise from the data
    - This often results in low error on training sets, but high error on test/validation sets
