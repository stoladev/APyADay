# APyADay
A .py everyday keeps me from dismay.

I will be uploading a .py project once a day for as long as I deem beneficial.
This is all done with the purpose of seeing my programming methods develop
with time and practice, as well as for the boredom of self-isolation thanks to
Corona-daddy.

### Update (05-16-2020)
Some files may be dated incorrectly when it comes to the initial commit date.
This is because of my pivot to using git control for *everything*, especially
when I am using Vimagit and Fugitive (which makes it all the more enjoyable).

I started this APyADay project using PyCharm. I am now using Vim full-time 
alongside an Archlinux OS, and I'd say I am full-time CLI-oriented (except for
browsing the internet of course). It's crazy to think how much has changed in
just less than 2 months.

### Update (06-21-2020)
I will be putting a pause on Python while I explore C# and program development.
Python has turned out to be a great entry-level programming language with
extremely useful libraries and capabilities. With C# I will further my interest
in OOP and see what comes of it - Surely I will come back to Python, but for
now I see more of a benefit when it comes to learning other languages.
