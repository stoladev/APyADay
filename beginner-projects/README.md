# Beginner Projects

A list of my Python Projects that are meant to be beginner-oriented. While I
may repeat these projects in the future to make use of newly-learned skills,
the simplicity of the programs/general code will remain similar.

# Contents

- [Censor
  Dispenser](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/beginner-projects/censor_dispenser)
    - File censoring using Regex patterns. Includes per-letter censoring, and
      allows for previous- and next-word censoring through the power of...
      regular expressions. 

- [Coded
  Correspondence](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/beginner-projects/coded_correspondence)
    - A Jupyter lab that focuses on the beginning lessons of how cryptography
      works - more specifically, how the Vigenere Cipher works.

- [ToDo List
  Application](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/beginner-projects/todo_list_app)
    - Simple tkinter-gui application using pickle methods to save and load
      information. Buttons and keyboard presses register adding/removing of
      items on the ToDo list.

- [Mouse Aim
  Game](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/beginner-projects/mouse_aim_game)
    - Makes use of Pygame. Simple menu system accompanied by a target to click,
      which in turn refreshes its position and hitbox. Useful for bettering
      skills that require quick mouse pointer accuracy with small hitboxes (FPS
      games, for example).
