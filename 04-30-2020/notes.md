## New Structure

I will be continuing the daily notes.md file. I am adding more daily .py files
that will be structured in "main ideas" that are learned - somewhat of a
note-taking type of solution to keep all of the information gathered from
Codecademy organized in a way where I can reference it whenever need be.

## Fuzzy File Searcher

FZF, or more specifically, Rg (ripgrep), is amazing. I feel like I am going to
get so used to it so quickly, I'm going to wonder how I managed to move around
a filesystem before finding it. The speed, efficiency, accuracy, and
ease-of-use regarding ripgrep searching is useful to the extent where I don't
think I'll be using a File Explorer for quite some time.

At 11:44PM, I've finally finished the configuration of FZF to my liking. It
allows me to search hidden files whenever I choose, move between files in my
buffer as I please, and find the the most nested files as I like. It's
great. I'm going to bed.

## WSL2 - Debian Kernel on Windows

I can now have the best of both worlds when it comes to Linux's filesystem and
bash paired with Windows 10's mainstream programs (I'm looking at you, Adobe.)
