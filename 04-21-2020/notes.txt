I will be starting daily note entries to accompany any programming that I've
done for that day. This will help me regarding my personal accountability, and
add to the overall "satisfaction" feeling I receive from keeping up with this
daily programming endeavor. 

Today I started with setting up an Anaconda virtual environment which had
TensorFlow, Keras, and other useful packages installed onto it. I've started
the process of learning linear regression and how it works, what it's useful
for, when to use it vs. not use it, etc. 

Learning the command line on a "deeper level" than what I've been accustomed
to over the years also peaked my interest, so I've taken up some classes
for that subject. So far, learning the basics of cat, grep, and alike really
seems like it will come in handy in the future, so no regrets of time waste
there.

I'd also love to begin learning Vim on a more serious level, but I suppose
I should take this all step-by-step instead of trying to sample a little
bit of everything at once. I've unfortunately already felt the mental
pushback of trying to learn SQL while juggling Python and other fundamentals.

Anyway, that's all for today. Hopefully tomorrow there will be more progress
as well as more to show regarding the steep learning curve that I must
overcome in order to achieve my goals for programming and development.
