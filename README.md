# Python Projects

Anything that has a code focus of Python will be included here. As the quantity
of projects increases, the file structure of this repo will change to reduce
clutter. Categories will soon come once I reach ~10 projects, ranging from
machine learning to GUI applications to messing with PyGame.

# Contents

- [A Py A
  Day](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/a-py-a-day)
    - Daily Python problem solving. On and off in terms of update
    frequency; sometimes a project I am working on requires full focus with no
    distractions, so I may not upload for that project's production length.

- [Censor
  Dispenser](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/censor_dispenser)
    - File censoring using Regex patterns. Includes per-letter censoring, and
      allows for previous- and next-word censoring through the power of...
      regular expressions. 

- [Coded
  Correspondence](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/coded_correspondence)
    - A Jupyter lab that focuses on the beginning lessons of how cryptography
      works - more specifically, how the Vigenere Cipher works.

- [ToDo List
  Application](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/todo_list_app)
    - Simple tkinter-gui application using pickle methods to save and load
      information. Buttons and keyboard presses register adding/removing of
      items on the ToDo list.

- [Mouse Aim
  Game](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/mouse_aim_game)
    - Makes use of Pygame. Simple menu system accompanied by a target to click,
      which in turn refreshes its position and hitbox. Useful for bettering
      skills that require quick mouse pointer accuracy with small hitboxes (FPS
      games, for example).
