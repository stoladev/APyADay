# Python Projects

## Contents
      
- [GUI Projects](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/gui-projects)
  - Projects that have a GUI (graphical user interface) will be in here. Applications with a broad
    range of use case scenarios will be placed here, using many types of Python-specific interface
    builders, from Tkinter to PyQt5.

- [Machine
  Learning](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/machine-learning)
    - All projects that incorporate machine learning will be found here. While
      there is no specific goal for each of the projects to achieve, the
      primary focus for anything in this section is learning more about machine
      learning and using neural nets for task completion and problem solving.
