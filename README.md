# Python Projects

Anything that has a code focus of Python will be included here.

- A Py A Day 
    - Daily Python problem solving. On and off in terms of update
    frequency; sometimes a project I am working on requires full focus with no
    distractions, so I may not upload for that project's production length.

- Censor Dispenser
    - File censoring using Regex patterns. Includes per-letter censoring, and
      allows for previous- and next-word censoring through the power of...
      regular expressions. 

- ToDo List Application
    - Simple tkinter-gui application using pickle methods to save and load
      information. Buttons and keyboard presses register adding/removing of
      items on the ToDo list.

- Mouse Aim Game
    - Makes use of Pygame. Simple menu system accompanied by a target to click,
      which in turn refreshes its position and hitbox. Useful for bettering
      skills that require quick mouse pointer accuracy with small hitboxes (FPS
      games, for example).
