# Python Projects

Anything that has a code focus of Python will be included here. As the quantity
of projects increases, the file structure of this repo will change to reduce
clutter. Categories will soon come once I reach ~10 projects, ranging from
machine learning to GUI applications to messing with PyGame.

# General Portfolio Projects
- [Bug Reporting
  System](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/gui-projects/bug_tracker)
  - Simple interface for creating a quick report for any issues regarding a company's website or
    applet. Takes a screenshot if necessary, straight from the applet. Generates the report into a
    zip file containing the written report and the screenshot.


# Contents

- [A Py A
  Day](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/a-py-a-day)
    - Daily Python problem solving. On and off in terms of update
    frequency; sometimes a project I am working on requires full focus with no
    distractions, so I may not upload for that project's production length.

- [Beginner
  Projects](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/beginner-projects)
    - A collection of my beginner projects that helped me learn the basics of
      Python. They may be redone from time to time to see how my skills have
      progressed, but their purpose and simplicity will remain similar.
      
- [GUI Projects](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/gui-projects)
  - Projects that have a GUI (graphical user interface) will be in here. Applications with a broad
    range of use case scenarios will be placed here, using many types of Python-specific interface
    builders, from Tkinter to PyQt5.

- [Machine
  Learning](https://github.com/stoladev/python-projects/tree/master/machine-learning)
    - All projects that incorporate machine learning will be found here. While
      there is no specific goal for each of the projects to achieve, the
      primary focus for anything in this section is learning more about machine
      learning and using neural nets for task completion and problem solving.
