## General Notes

So I have finally configured Vim after spending about an hour making sure that
the settings are set in such a way where I won't be tempted to go back and fix
something up or correct a pet peeve.

## Turning Away From Auto-Completion

Kite has seemed useful until I've read about the initial learning curve of
programming and why having an IDE 'do everything for you' may be
counterproductive to the attempts of learning syntax and all of the nifty
features IDE's provide for you, on your own. With something such as error
detection being run every single time you type a character, or even worse - it
being automatically corrected for you - it defeats the purpose of learning the
correct methods of writing code and instead holds your hand as if you were a
toddler that will never learn to do it the right way. Having a linter and PEP8
guideline checkers is enough when it comes to making sure your code practices
are right - the positive reinforcement you get when you save the code and
notice no lint gutter pop up is quite nice.

## Less Is More

Creating abundance in programming helpers and assistants isn't worth it when
it comes to the intial learning curve of a language. There are exceptions when
it comes to code processing such as error checks or when working on large-scale
projects - the room for error when it comes to programming for a large company
definitely outweighs any benefits of "programming without help". However, when
the circumstances allow for it, programming without these hyper-sensitive
error-correcting hand-holders makes for a better, longer lasting, and faster
learning experience. Anyway, enough babble.
