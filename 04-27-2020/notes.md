## General

Today marks the day where I will cease micro-improving my Vim configurations. I
can't see the benefit in continuing these mini improvements and tweaks so early
on in my Vim-learning journey. I've switched from Vim to NeoVim because of the
forward-thinking devs and community, alongside the track of NeoVim and it's
goal to become the "Modern Vim". 

I've certainly made strides in configuring Vim in a way where it will be
interchangeable with whatever IDE I choose. The benefits of learning Vim right
now are great because of the new ability to use it no matter what system, or
how old. 

I'm also looking forward to applying my Vim knowledge to modern IDE's such as
PyCharm and Visual Studio Code. It seems that both offer Vim emulation, and I
will make sure to take benefit of that and any additional Vim-like additions to
my programming skillset growth potential.

Tomorrow is going to see a more Python focused day alongside any remaining Vim
configuration additions to my public Github. I'll also be working on the
website, which is certainly overdue.
