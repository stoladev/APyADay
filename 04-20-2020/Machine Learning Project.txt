I've switched to a Windows 10 environment due to work reasons and an easier
way to keep up with Python development concerning TensorFlow.

My project goals will be any combination of the following:
  -Image recognition
    -Squirrel recognition
    -Bird recognition
  -Pathing algorithms
    -Set a point A and point B, find shortest route
      -Auto generate a maze
      -Allow to see logic process
      -Allow to change logic process (change algorithm)
    -Set a from-address and a to-address, path using map
  -Sorting algorithms

I will be uploading daily progress to APyADay, but only in segmented files.
The full projects will be uploaded to their respective Python Project folders.

Wish me luck!
