I've completed the Introduction to Bash Scripting course today. I've also
started up the Python lessons again, taking a break from SQL. I'll continue
with Python because at the moment, it's coming to me much easier and sticking
than SQL. SQL doesn't seem that difficult, but switching back and forth is
proving to be more of a struggle than a benefit.
