## General Notes

I've been messing with Vim all day, trying to configure it and attempt to
migrate to using it as my IDE before I develop any hard-to-drop habits
on other IDE's. Vim seems like the best bet when it comes to compatibility,
availability, and ease-of-use (after the steep learning curve, of course). 

## Vim

I have been successful in fully integrating Vim onto this Windows 10 system.
While I may be a W10 newbie (Arch Linux has been my home for quite a while),
I am getting the hang of it and I'm beginning to see the fruits of my labor
when it comes to efficiency with file editing and ease-of-access with fewer
and fewer keystrokes as time goes on. It's a wonderous experience to have as
long as you remain conscious of where your "skillset" began.

## Python

Continuing Codecademy's lessons on Python is becoming a breeze and somewhat of
a daily ritual. I wake up, drink some coffee, go for a walk, come back, speak
with my girlfriend and eat lunch together over Discord, and bam - right into
Codecademy. I'm spending at least an hour a day on the site and I am certainly
seeing the benefits when it comes to understanding how programming works, even
at such a base level. 

## Final Thoughts and ToDo's

With Vim being so configurable, it becomes a bit of a hassle to keep everything
in check. What do I mean? I thought I had the .vimrc file location fully
figured out, and yet we're at a standstill regarding plugin/autoload/pathogen
file synchronicity. Hopefully tomorrow is a more fruitful day when it comes to
wrapping up the initial Vim learning curve of set-up, and I can finally get
programming using this powerful text editor.
