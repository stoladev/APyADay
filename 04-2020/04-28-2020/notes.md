## General Notes

Another day has gone by where I cannot get my hands off of configuring Neovim
to my liking. I get flustered when an addition I've made to Neovim, whether
it's a plugin or a config change, doesn't go as planned. I then go down a
rabbithole of information regarding things that I shouldn't be focusing on,
such as Ack and Perl not working from Windows PowerShell. I keep getting an
impulse of scrapping Windows 10 and going back to Archlinux, but I then
remember why I switched to Windows in the first place: to focus on the Python
programming and tune out all things not immediately necessary. 

## No More init.vim Modifications

Starting tomorrow, I cannot allow myself to play with Vim's config unless a
study-stopping event happens where it needs my fixing to continue. All of my
work should be taking place on my PyCharm IDE, not on Vim. Of course, I have
IdeaVim installed as a plugin on PyCharm, so I will feel right at home. It's
weird to say that Vim feels like 'home' after only 2 weeks of constant use, but
I suppose that's what happens when an editor is so logical and natural to use.

## Learn Grep/Similar File Searcher

With Python getting increasingly more difficult, I need to establish an easy
solution to scanning through my Python notes to easily move in and out of files
for reference. While this sounds like an excuse to mess with Vim's config, this
has more to do with installing and learning Grep syntax than actual Vim
modification.

## Pip and Choco Cleanup

The scatter of files and their redundancy through different installation
mechanisms is certainly going to bite me in the future if I don't take care of
it now. Cleaning up will not only be a lesson for the future, but it will also
save my future self from headaches.
